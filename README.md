# Restaurant-Case-Study

The restaurant business has become increasingly competitive, with many customers opting to order food to their desired location rather than dinning in. This has put pressure on established restaurants to maintain their operations at normal levels amidst the continuous opening of new competing restaurants with new concepts and offerings. C, a company with several restaurants in Cyprus, is facing a similar challenge with one of its brands specializing in Asian cuisine struggling to maintain its profit margin and growth due to increased competition and changes in customer habits. To combat this, C plans to leverage its sales data to better understand customer consumption patterns and preferences.
With this in mind, the relations between the many menu products were analysed and the most common combinations were identified. This analysis was made according to different perspectives since it is normal for restaurants to have different attendance and order rates according to the time of the year. It is also usual for orders to differ depending on where the customers chose to eat: dine-in or at home via a delivery service.
With this analysis, it was possible to propose a new menu (with prices) to the restaurant; one with less items and products that (according to the analysis) the customers like to consume.

## Cross-selling

Creating set menus; Introducing new products; Recommending/promoting Cross-selling
Idea: Conduct Decision Making, from a flow perspective. Customers pick their combo by picking their starter first, looking at the sides and choosing appetizers after. This won't be like a make your one pasta restaurant where it's fast paced, low cost and literally all about customer decision. Although we want them to pick, we want to help them pick by seeing the possible sides on a menu, while they calmly sit down and enjoy the experience
